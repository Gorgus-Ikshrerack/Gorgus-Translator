# Install

### Install Requirements
- Python <3.13 (3.13 does not work with the spacy Python module, 3.12.9 is recommended)
- Git (for automatic updates)

### Actual Install
**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you `git clone` the repository! This means the `.git` folder is present, otherwise auto-updates won't work!

First of all, you need a version of Python less than 3.13 as 3.13 is not supported.

If you're on Windows you can run the `install.bat` file and it will do everything for you,
for MacOS and Linux the bash script `install.sh` for installing and `run.sh` will do the heavy lifting.

And you should be all set!

Then, just run `main.py`.

# Updating
The app will tell you when you need updates, and you can apply them when needed.
