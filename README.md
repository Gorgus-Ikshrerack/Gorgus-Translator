# Gorgus-Translator
A translator for a conlang called Gorgus me and some friends are actively working on.

# Install
First of all, you need a version of Python less than 3.13 as 3.13 is not supported.

If you're on Windows you can run the `install.bat` file and it will do everything for you,
for MacOS and Linux the following commands should work: (do this inside the repository folder)
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

And you should be all set!

Then, just run `main.py`.
