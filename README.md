# Gorgus-Translator
A translator for a conlang called Gorgus me and some friends are actively working on.

# Install
First of all, you need a version of Python less than 3.13 as 3.13 is not supported.

If you're on Windows you can run the `install.bat` file and it will do everything for you,
for MacOS and Linux the bash script `install.sh` for installing and `run.sh` will do the heavy lifting.

And you should be all set!

Then, just run `main.py`.

# Updating
The app will tell you when you need updates, and you can apply them when needed.
